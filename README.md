# ComfyUI-MotionThiefExperiment

This is an experimental node pack to test using reference videos for their motion.

It isn't compatible with a lot of things as this is a hacky implementation for experiments only.

## Examples
See example workflow in `example_workflows` to get started. It uses the basic mechanism but there is also an advanced (Custom) settings.

Reference videos are the first on the left.
